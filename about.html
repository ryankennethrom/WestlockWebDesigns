                This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
                that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
                content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
                to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
                content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
                of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
                about making the content accessible and easy to read.
